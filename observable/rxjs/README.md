# Quiz

### 1. Explain the Observer design pattern.

- The Observer design pattern establishes a one-to-many relationship where a subject maintains a list of observers. Observers can dynamically register(e.g. subscribe in the RxJs library) or unregister(unsubscribe) with the observable. When the state of the subject changes, it iterates through its list of observers and notifies them using specific methods like update() or next(). This notification mechanism allows the subject to push data or state changes to observers without being tightly coupled.

### 2. Explain the advantages of the Observer design pattern.

- Advantages include decoupling between subjects and observers and flexibility in adding/removing observers. Observers are notified automatically of state changes, eliminating the need for continuous polling/checking.

### 3. Explain what we mean by saying that Rx observables are cold.

- Rx observables are "cold" because they are lazy by nature; they do not produce data until someone subscribes. Each subscription creates a new and independent execution context of the observable sequence. Hence, this enables the planning and composition of operations before execution.

### 4. How does Rx enhance the Observer interface of the Observable design pattern?

- **Single Assignment**: In Rx, each observable typically manages a single observer, ensuring each subscriber has its dedicated execution context. Observers receive values emitted by the observable via the **`next()`** method.
- **Error Handling**: Observables in Rx notify observers of errors using the **`error()`** method. This allows for proper error propagation and handling within the observable sequence.
- **Completion Notification**: Rx observables can signal the end of the observable sequence by calling the observer's **`complete()`** method. This notifies subscribers that the observable has finished emitting values and won't produce anymore.

### 5. What are observers?

- These are objects that are interested in receiving updates or notifications from a subject observable when its state changes. Observers are registered with the subject and are notified when the observable's state changes.

### 6. What is an Observable in the context of Reactive Extensions (Rx)?

- In Rx, an Observable represents a sequence of data or events over time that can be observed. It can asynchronously or synchronously emit multiple values or a single value, lazily (cold) or eagerly (hot), unicast to a single consumer (cold), or multicast to multiple consumers (hot).

### 7. Compare promises and Rx observables.

- **Execution Model:**
   - Promises execute immediately upon creation while observables require a subscription for execution because they are lazy(cold), hence they allow for planning and composing operations before execution, making them suitable for continuous data streams.
   - Rx observables can emit a single or multiple values over time, unlike promises which resolve to a single value or error.

- **Flexibility and Planning:**
   - Promises: Lack of the ability to plan or compose operations before execution. Planning what we want to do while executing asynchronous operations; mixing planning and execution.
   - Rx Observables: Provide powerful composition capabilities with operators(map, filter...) to separate planning from execution.

- **Usage in I/O Libraries:**
   - Promises: Traditionally used for handling one-time asynchronous tasks.
   - Rx Observables: Increasingly adopted in modern I/O libraries (e.g., Angular's HttpClient) due to their composability and flexibility in managing continuous streams of asynchronous data.

### 8. Compare and contrast the Observer design pattern with the approach taken by RxJS.

- The Observer pattern directly manages relationships, while RxJS abstracts this with observables and operators for flexible stream handling.

### 9. Why might RxJS be more suitable for complex asynchronous operations compared to traditional Observer implementations?

- RxJS offers declarative and composable ways to handle asynchronous data streams, which can simplify complex operations compared to managing individual observers.

### 10. What does it mean for a program to be reactive?

- Being reactive means responding to changes or events in real-time, often with asynchronous data streams and declarative programming.

### 11. Discuss how reactive programming can simplify dealing with asynchronous data streams.

- Reactive programming provides tools to manipulate and react to asynchronous data streams declaratively, avoiding callback complexity.

### 12. Describe the role of operators in RxJS. Do they change the actual observable?
In simple words, we can say that operators are simply methods that can be used with Observables or Subjects of RxJS. RxJS operators facilitate us to change the original observable in some manner and return a new observable. The operators do not change the existing observable. They simply modify it and return a new one.

- Operators in RxJS transform, filter, combine, or create new observables, providing powerful tools for stream manipulation.

### 13. How does error handling in RxJS improve upon traditional try/catch mechanisms in asynchronous programming?

- RxJS allows errors to be handled at specific points in observable streams using operators like `catchError`, offering more control and flexibility.

### 14. Explain the concept of multicasting in RxJS and how it is achieved.

- Multicasting in RxJS shares a single execution of an observable among multiple subscribers using subjects or `share` operator.

### 15. What is pipelining in RxJS, and how does it relate to operators?

- Pipelining in RxJS involves chaining multiple operators together using the `pipe` operator to transform or filter observables in a sequence.

### 16. Contrast promise-based asynchrony with Rx-based asynchrony.

- Promises handle single future values, while Rx observables manage sequences of values over time with flexible stream manipulation.

### 17. Write an RxJS piece of code that prints out a sequence of prime numbers, one after the other, each second. Assume we have a synchronous function called isPrime that checks whether a number is prime. (5 pts)

```bash
import { interval } from "rxjs";
import { filter } from "rxjs/operators";

const isPrime = (num: number): boolean => {
    if (num <= 1) return false;
    for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); ++i) {
        if (num % i === 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

const observable = interval(1000).pipe(
    filter(x => isPrime(x)) // Emit only prime numbers
);

observable.subscribe({
    next: (prime) => {
        console.log(`${prime} is a prime number.`);
    },
    error: (err) => {
        console.error('An error occurred:', err);
    },
    complete: () => {
        console.log('Observable complete.');
    }
});
```

### 18. Write how the Observer interface will look like in Java.

```bash
public interface Observer<T> {
	   void update(T notification);
}
```

### 19. How would the method `update()` be implemented in the Observer class?

```bash
protected final void notify(T notification) {
   for (Observer<T> observer : observers) {
      observer.update(notification);
     }
}
```

### 20. Are observables async or sync?

- Observables can be asynchronous or synchronous, emitting values over time without blocking the main thread.

### 21. Rx Observable is described metaphorically as a recipe, what does recipe refer to in this context?

- A Function is just a recipe. When subscribing to the observable, then the function will start executing; since Observables are cold, you need a subscriber to use that recipe; it can't do anything by itself.
### 22. In the Windows case study, what is the observer, and why is it said to be active?
- The file system is the truth holder(source of data), it's the acting entity because the window doesn't actively observe, it just subscribes and asks back for data.
  - Or
- The file system is the active entity or "truth holder" in this case. The window, acting as the observer, subscribes to the file system to receive updates or data when needed, rather than actively monitoring it continuously.

### 23. Do all concrete observers implement the update method from the observer interface in the same way?
- No, the interface just acts as a contract between the observer and the observable. Hence, the update method can be implemented differently based on specific functionality and requirements within the application; concrete observers don't care about the method but about their specific logic.

### 24. Can we consider the update method as a callback function?
- Yes, the update method can be considered a callback function. This method is invoked by the observable to notify observers of changes or events. It's passed as an argument.

### 25. What do we mean by observer artifacts?
- Observer artifacts are interfaces defining how observers react to events emitted by observables, including methods like next(), error(), and complete().

### 26. Compare functions and observables.
- Both of them are cold.
- A function produces data when it executes
- A function can produce only one data
- Observables can produce a stream of events
- Observables push events whenever they want to.
- Observable sub-observers, it’s hot, and all the obeservers in the list, share the same context(one execution context).
### 27. Explain how `pipe()` works.
- Returns another observable (nothing happens); just encapsulates a new plan, data hasn’t been produced yet. Customizing the plan with pipe, and the result is the new plan(a new observable), hence, it will produce exactly what we want. The advantage of pipelining is separating planning from execution.
### 28. What is the advantage of pipelining?
- Separating planning from execution.
